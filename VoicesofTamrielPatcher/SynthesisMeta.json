  "OneLineDescription": "Patch your load order to integrate Voices of Tamriel",
  "LongDescription": "This patcher will iterate your entire load order and pseudo-randomly mix in voices from my mod Voices of Tamriel. Unique NPCs are skipped to maintain compatibility with both VOT and as many other mods as possible.\r\n\r\nNote: This will NOT replace every vanilla voice type with ones from VOT. That is by design. You will still hear vanilla voices, just not from every single NPC :)",
